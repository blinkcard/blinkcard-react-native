 * - SDK initialization
 * - Resource downloading
 * - License verification
 *
 * It ensures that only one SDK instance exists at any time.
 *
 * You can call this method in advance to **preload** the SDK before starting a scanning session.
 * Doing so reduces loading time for the {@link performScan} and {@link performDirectApiScan} methods,
 * since all resources will already be available and the license verified.
 *
 * If you do not call this method beforehand, it will still be automatically invoked on the native platform channels
 * when a scan starts. However, the initial scan may take longer due to resource loading and license checks.
